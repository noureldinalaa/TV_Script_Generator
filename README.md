# TV_Script_Generator
Generate TV script from Seinfeld dataset (This Project is part from Udacity's deep learning nanodegree).

## Project Overview
In this project, we will generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. we will be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we will build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
